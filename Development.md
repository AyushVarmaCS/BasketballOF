Week 1:
Creating proposal 
Week 2:
Made images instead of shapes. Getting used to ofxbox2d and how it works.
Week 3:
Tried to make a project motion, but decided against it. Worked on contact listener, but didn't have it fully finished. Didn't discover how to
work on it through polymorphism.
Week 4:
Figured out how to detect collision, did by polymorphism through ofxcontactlistener. Added sounds for specific purposes(dribble, scoring).
Added scoring and made a swish noise when scoring. Had to implement a way to detect what's the hoop and what's not by figuring out 
dynamic bodies and static bodies. Made hoop a dynamic body, but practically unmovable as to not mistake for a wall(static.) Added hoop
blockers to make the game more difficult.
