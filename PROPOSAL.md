For my final project, I would like to make a basketball related game. It would not be a full blown 5v5 basketball game, but rather a basic shooting basketball game. The way the game would work is the player would shoot a basketball from an angle that they choose and if they make a shot, increment the score by one, but no effect if the player misses a shot. There is 30 second time limit for every round and there are 8 rounds. I would also like to keep high scores for this. The game would be in a GUI similar to the OF snake that was given to us. Coding wise, the only background I would have working with this is minimal openframeworks experience from the snake project and C++ experience from this semester. General background wise, Iâ€™m a big fan of basketball and have played similar basketball shooting games before.

A library that I would like to use would be the sound library in C++. The specific sound library that I would use is known as the SoundTouch library which supports tempo, pitch, and playback rate. The purpose of the SoundTouch game would be to have sound throughout the game and for certain situations, for example: random background music throughout the game, a failure sound if the player misses a shot, a positive chime if the player makes a shot, tempo change throughout the later rounds, etc. I would also possibly like to make the game so that every round gets harder as the player progresses through the game, i.e. the hoop moving(slowly) in the second round and moving faster in the subsequent rounds.
